# AndroidMapClustering
A simple Google Map for Android with clustering of default markers.

For a version with custom map markers, please check [catzie/Simple-Android-Map-Clustering-with-Custom-Markers](https://github.com/catzie/Simple-Android-Map-Clustering-with-Custom-Markers/)

I simply took necessary files from Android Maps Utility Demo to create a basic app with a map with clustering (custom markers) feature, hoping it would be useful for developers who need only this feature from the Android Maps Utility Demo.

Feel free to use this as a basis of your new projects.

## Before running this app
Edit app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml and place your Android API key. My dev notes in the link below has a guide on how one could get such API key.
